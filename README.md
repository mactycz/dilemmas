## Dilemmas

This is a simple Streamlit app for creating, managing, and printing dilemma cards.  
Each card contains a question and two possible answers.

I created this app to make it easier for me, my friends, and my family to create, print, and cut out dilemma cards for fun during family gatherings.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit

### Run the app
```bash

Note: The app is currently written in Polish.
